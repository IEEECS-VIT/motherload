                    <div class="card-content"><p style="text-align: justify">This time graVITas 2016 brings along a surge of innovation with itself because the need of the hour is to create something that is not only new but also sustainable and implementable for our needs; for India's needs. The theme for graVITas 2016 is <strong>Sustainable Social Innovations</strong>. We define social innovation as the development and implementation of new ideas to meet social needs. These innovations are driven by social values as primary imperative rather than private financial appropriation and the products developed eliminate harmful impacts on ecological systems, human health and communities.  We wish to empower the youth by channeling their ideas for the overall good of the society and thus graVITas '16 is a stepping stone for all such innovations and innovators. </p>
