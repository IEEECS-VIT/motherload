Both of them complete a segment of the course and reach a point where they separate. At this point the participants have to make a quick decision which one will go through which path. One of the course will consist of lasers and sensors whereas in the other the participant will have to cross through a demanding track made of ropes, tyres and bamboos. The event requires good co-ordination among the team members. The scoring is based on the number of lasers, sensors left undisturbed as well as how well the Rope track has been crossed. The team to finish the course in least time possible as well as complete the tasks efficiently is declared a winner.<br>'+
