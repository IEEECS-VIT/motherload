The introductory session, consisting of basics of 3-D Printing and additive manufacturing, processes, materials and printers used in the process, 3-D Printers set up during the workshop will demostrate the technology to the students live. The next session will introduce the participants to basics of CAD software designing and slicing technique. The students will be given several useful softwares and taught to design their own objects. The third session, focusses specifically on Metal RP (Rapid Prototyping). The students shall be shown several high grade metal components made using titanium and aluminium. After the lunch break, the fourth session, consisting of 3-D scanning, will showcase state of the art 3-D scanners. At the end the students will have the hands-on sessions with the scanners and printers. This is the most interesting and exciting part for the participants, because most of them haven’t seen or used a 3-D Printer before.
